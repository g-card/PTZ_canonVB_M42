# PTZ_canonVB_M42

##ROS interface for PTZ camera (this may work with others Canon's cameras) and few programs useful for:
- reading video from PTZ camera (Canon VB M42);
- finding parameters of the camera using a chessboard (with OpenCV);
- sending commands (with http server of the PTZ camera);
- doing some video analysis (with OpenCV).

###Note that you'll need [this package](https://github.com/BrunoDatoMeneses/M1_ISTR/tree/master/Ligne_transitique_MONTRAC) to run the ROS interface of the camera.
